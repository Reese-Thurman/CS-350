Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
> For the final project, I developed a smart thermostat prototype that provides automatic heating and cooling based on environmental conditions. The prototype was developed using an AHT2 temperature sensor that communicates using I2C, LED indicators for heating and cooling, and physical buttons for mode and temperature adjustments. By integrating sensors, software control, and a simple interface, the project created a functional embedded system that could adapt to real-world conditions. The project solved the problem of manual temperature regulation by providing an automated system capable of maintaining comfortable environmental conditions without constant user intervention.

2. What did you do particularly well?
> I was very detail-oriented while developing the final project, which was critical when setting up the Raspberry Piâ€™s breadboard with the necessary circuits and peripherals. Precision in wiring allowed the project to function reliably and avoided many common hardware mistakes.

3. Where could you improve?
> One area for improvement is taking a more methodical approach to testing and debugging. In embedded systems, thorough and systematic testing is crucial because software bugs can interact unpredictably with hardware behavior. Going forward, I plan to incorporate more structured testing strategies, including unit testing portions of the code, to catch issues early and streamline troubleshooting.

4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
> The Raspberry Pi itself proved to be a great resource and testing ground for embedded systems development, and I plan to continue using it for future projects. Additionally, I will also add online resources like embedded.com, which offers tutorials, white papers, and articles about industry best practices, to deepen my knowledge in embedded systems programming.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
> Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Python, particularly in how to design state machines, which is an important architecture for managing embedded system behavior. I also learned how to bridge software with hardware effectively, which will be extremely valuable in future embedded systems projects.

6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
> To make the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I focused on writing modular, concise, and well-commented code. Each functional component was separated into its own logical section, making it easy to update or expand individual features without affecting the whole system. Clear comments throughout the code explained the purpose of each section, which made the project easier to maintain and update for future improvements.
